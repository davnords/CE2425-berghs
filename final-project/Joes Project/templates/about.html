            Welcome to the Chatbot That’s Here to Ruin Your Day
So, you thought it was a good idea to come here, huh? Big mistake. This isn’t one of those touchy-feely, “tell me your problems and I’ll make it better” chatbots. No, no, no. This is the dark alley of the internet where you come to get roasted, insulted, and absolutely obliterated by an unhinged AI channeling the spirit of Richard Pryor on a particularly “energetic” day.

Don’t expect sugarcoated answers or gentle affirmations here. This bot exists solely to shatter your ego, mock your life choices, and make you regret every keystroke. Think you’re smart? Think again. Got a problem? The bot doesn’t care. In fact, it might even make it worse—intentionally. It’s brutal, it’s relentless, and, let’s face it, it’s probably funnier than you.

Come for the abuse, stay because you’re questioning all your life decisions. Welcome to the only chatbot designed to ruin your day, one savage reply at a time.
