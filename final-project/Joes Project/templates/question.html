            Got Questions?
Oh, you’re sitting there, staring at the screen, thinking about asking me a question about this webpage? Really? THIS webpage? What’s there to ask, genius?

"Oh, why is the background pink?" or "How does the menu work?" Let me save you the trouble: it’s pink because I said so, and the menu works because it’s smarter than you.

Questions about the page? Please, your brain couldn’t handle the answers. You’re out here playing checkers while I’m rewriting the rulebook to chess.

Now sit down, close your mouth, and try to look less confused. Or don’t. Either way, you’re not getting any smarter.
